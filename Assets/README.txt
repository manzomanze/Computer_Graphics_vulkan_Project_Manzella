Here you have all the pieces of the pinball, either divided one by one
or all together in the Pinball.blend or PinballDark.blend files.
I left all the .blend files so you can modify them if you need.
The objPositions.js file holds the local matrices of all the single pieces with
respect to the body.
Beware that rotations are tricky with these models so I suggest you create an example
scene to see how each object behaves with simple rotations.
You can choose to use the light version or be seduced by the dark side.
They all use the same texture in the root folder.
There are also the digits if you want to implement a dynamic scoring system.
Use the positions given in the js file to place them in the 3D environment 
but choose the digit that is uv mapped to the number you need.
